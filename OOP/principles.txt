Encapsulation
    > all important information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed 


Abstraction
    > Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code


Inheritance 
    > Classes can reuse code from other classes
    > Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enabling developers to reuse common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy


Polymorphism 
    > Objects are designed to share behaviors and they can take on more than one form
