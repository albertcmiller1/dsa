Abstraction
    > Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code
    > abstract classes and methods

Encapsulation
    > all important information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed 
    > the data members that describe an object are hidden from environment that is external to class.
    > In Python, prefixing name of variable/method with single or double underscore to emulate behavior of protected and private access modifiers.

Inheritance 
    > Classes can reuse code from other classes
    > Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enabling developers to reuse common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy


Polymorphism 
    > Objects are designed to share behaviors and they can take on more than one form
    > polymorphism occurs when each sub class provides its own implementation of an abstract method in base class.
