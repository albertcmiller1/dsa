Backtracking is an optimization that involves abandoning a "path" once it is determined that the path cannot lead to a solution. 
    > In an exhaustive search, we generate all possibilities and then check them for solutions. 
    > In backtracking, we prune paths that cannot lead to a solution, generating far fewer possibilities.


// let curr represent the thing you are building
// it could be an array or a combination of variables
function backtrack(curr) {
    if (base case) {
        Increment or add to answer
        return
    }

    for (iterate over input) {
        Modify curr
        backtrack(curr)
        Undo whatever modification was done to curr
    }
}

> each call to the function backtrack represents a node in the tree 
> each iteration in the for loop represents a child of the curent node 
> calling backtrack() in that loop reprents moving to a child 
> the line where we undo th modifications is the "backtracking" step and is dquivalent to maving back up the tree from a child to parent 
> the path from the root to the node represents a candidate that is being built
> leaf nodes are complete solutions and represent when the base case is reached



Permutaions
    > A permutation contains all the elements of nums with no duplicates.
    > givin [1, 2, 3]
    > return [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]


Subsets
    > givin [1, 2, 3]
    > return [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
    > subset can have any length up to N 
    > Order does not matter -> [1,2] and [2,1] is the same subet
