E <= V^2
E -> edges 
V -> number of verticies aka nodes 



three ways to represent a graph: 
    1. Array of Edges                       -> build an adjaceny list (map)
    2. Matrix (common)                      -> list of lists 
    3. Adjacency Matrix (less common)       -> sqaure matrix where the dimentions represent the nodes. typically square. ex) adjMatrix[v1][v2] = 1 means an edge exists from v1 to v2
    4. Adjaceny List (common)               -> basically a linked list/tree, but holds a list of pointers each node points to
