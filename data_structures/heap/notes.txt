tree like data structure (actually an array)

A heap is a great option whenever you need to find the maximum or minimum of something repeatedly.

If a heap is configured to find/remove the min element, it's called a min heap. 
If it's configured to find/remove the max element, it's called a max heap.

If you're dealing with numbers and you want to deal with the opposite type of heap that your language implements, an easy way to do this is to multiply all numbers by -1.
python defaults to a min heap. 

Add an element:             O(log N)
Remove the minimum element: O(logn)
Find the minimum element:   O(1)

heapify runs in O(N)
