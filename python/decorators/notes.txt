You'll use a decorator when you need to change the behavior of a function without modifying the function itself. 

To create a decorator function in Python... 
    > create an outer function that takes a function as an argument. 
    > There is also an inner function that wraps around the decorated function.

You can use decorators with classes as well
    > there is no @ character involved. With the __call__ method the decorator is executed when an instance of the class is created.
