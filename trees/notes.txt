Full Tree: each node either points to 0 or 2 children. no single children (assuming a binary tree)
Perfect Tree: the bottom level is full of children 
Complete Tree: no gaps from left to right on the bottom level. 
Leaf: a node with no children 


binary search tree: the values of each number are places in order 
    O(log(n))



DPS 
    > Depth-first search 
    > The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

BFS 
    > Breadth-first search
    > It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

maximum depth of binary tree 
    > the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
