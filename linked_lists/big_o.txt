big(O)

add a node to the end: 
    O(1)
    just set tail.next = newNode

remove node from end: 
    O(N)
    must traverse list so we dont lose previous 

add item to front: 
    O(1)
    already have pointer to head 

removing head 
    O(1)
    move pointer over and remove node 

add item in middle of list:
    O(n)
    need to iterate though the list 

find a node: 
    O(n)
